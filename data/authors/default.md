I love encountering undefined and difficult to solve, understand, or digest problems.

## Recondite Capital

I own and operate an Investment Advisor, [Recondite Capital](https://reconditecapital.com), registered in Illinois state. Absolutely no commentary herein regards investment advice, recommendations, or solicitations to buy and/or sell securities.
