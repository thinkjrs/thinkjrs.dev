If you program or write software for a living I'm willing to bet that you use Github Acions for CI/CD. 

This week I was cleaning up an old actions script that runs Google Lighthouse on web properties for work [@Tincre](https://tincre.com) and needed to modify
a URL returned by an action step with RegEx.

Here's the setup and how I accomplished that. Hopefully it helps you move quicker and get more done! 

## Modifying a variable

First of all, I needed to keep this script in its current form to fit with our release schedule. I also needed to not modify any other steps, aside from variable names. 

But it was failing due to a URL being changed upstream, which I needed to now
modify insie the action. Let's dive into what the script does and what I did to rectify the problem.

### Grab a URL from an external service

The script grabs a preview URL from Vercel when our apps build. To do so, we use the vercel-preview-url-action by aaimio. 

This provides a variable we can access with `steps.vercel_preview_url.outputs.vercel_preview_url` in proceeding steps.

### New - Modify the URL using `sed`

Now that URL has some cruft at the beginning and end of which we want to rid ourselves. So let's grab the varable, use `echo` to pipe it to `sed` and some RegEx to remove the cruft. After all that we'll save it to a new variable. 

```yaml
- name: reformat_vercel_preview_url
  id: reformat_vercel_preview_url
  run: |
    URL=$(echo "${{ steps.vercel_preview_url.outputs.vercel_preview_url }}" | sed -E 's|^(https://)vercel\.live/open-feedback/(.*)(\?.*)$|\1\2|')
    echo "::set-output name=reformatted_vercel_preview_url::$URL"
  shell: bash
``` 

#### What's going on in the `run` command?

Let's break down what's happening in that `run` directive. 

1. We echo the previous URL variable, setting it to the local URL variable, only available in that Github action step. Importantly, this executes the entire command (including `sed`).
2. We pipe `|` that value to the linux utility `sed`.
3. We use `sed` to use the RegEx provided to exclude the matches, leaving only the string we'd like.
4. We use `echo` to set a variable `reformatted_vercel_preview_url` which we can use in the next step.

### Use the modified url in the proceeding step

The proceeding step then uses the variable we set prior to send to lighthouse.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Audit preview URL with Lighthouse
  id: lighthouse_audit
  uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v11
  with:
    urls: |
      ${{ steps.reformat_vercel_preview_url.outputs.reformatted_vercel_preview_url }}
    uploadArtifacts: true
    temporaryPublicStorage: true
 ```

## The complete `lighthouse.yaml` script

For completeness, here's a complete Github Action script to run Google Lighthouse on your Vercel deployments in your Github Pull Requests.

```yaml
