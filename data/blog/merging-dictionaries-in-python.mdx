At [Tincre](https://tincre.com) I use a dictionary merging (and class construction) strategy
that is highly flexible and allows us to reason well with our JavaScript/TypeScript frontends that 
serve client users. You can read about that on our [Slightly Sharpe blog](https://slightlysharpe.com/blog/data-modeling-at-tincre) for the deets.

But herein, I'm simply going to show you how we actually merge Python dictionaries
that have lots of `Nonetype` values and sparsely, `str` or other value types, like `int` or `float` values.

## Merging strategies

So let's start with an example [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev) `PaymentFeatures` class, which we'll use as
our dictionary, per se. 

> You can use the `.dict()` method to get back a dictionary on Pydantic objects.

```python 
# pydantic

class PaymentFeatures(BaseModel):
    """A class to model data features (columns) for
    the Payment table stored in our PostgreSQL database"""
    myParam: Union[str, None] = None
    myOtherParam: Union[str, None] = None
```
Oftentimes I need to merge several dictionaries with the same keys but **don't want
`None` values to overwrite keys with `str` or to be specific, non-`Nonetype`, values.** 

If you're a regular Pythonista you know that this behavior isn't totally built-in or rather, not available off-the-shelf.

### Regular dictionary merging 

If you want to simply merge two dictionaries, keeping the last seen value for shared keys, Python 3.9
adds the `Dict` union operator with [PEP 584](https://peps.python.org/pep-0584/). 

> Check out how the CPython API was updated [via the original PR #12088](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12088).

To combine two dictionaries simply:

```python
my_dict0 = dict(awesomeKeyName = "awesome value 0")
my_dict1 = dict(awesomeKeyName = "awesome value 1")
# return a new dict
my_merged_dict_1_overwrites_0 = my_dict0 | my_dict1
print(my_merged_dict_1_overwrites_0)
```

Yeah, you're right, that's super cool. And the community was thrilled with the addition to the Python `dict` built-in. Life was made easier, thanks to open-source, yet again. I digress.

And yes, for those language lawyers out there, you can also do the same thing in-place:

```python
my_dict0 = dict(awesomeKeyName = "awesome value 0",)
my_dict1 = dict(
    awesomeKeyName = "awesome value 1",
    anotherAwesomeKeyName = "awesome value 1 for anotherAwesomeKeyName",
)
# in-place modification of my_dict0
my_dict0 |= my_dict1
print(my_dict0)
```

#### But that `None` behavior...

What happens when one of these key values is of type `None`? In particular, will `Nonetype` values overwrite
strings and other values? 

Let's examine the situation by replacing the string value for `awesomeKeyName` in `my_dict1` with `None`. 

Look at this result:

```python
my_dict0 = dict(awesomeKeyName = "awesome value 0",)
my_dict1 = dict(
    awesomeKeyName = None,
    anotherAwesomeKeyName = "awesome value 1 for anotherAwesomeKeyName",
)
# in-place modification of my_dict0
my_dict0 |= my_dict1
print(my_dict0)
```

Oh no! That's not what we want (but what we should expect). 

### `Nonetype` avoidance merging 

So let's use [dictionary comprehensions]() to get the job done and then throw that
into a simple function you can reuse.

```python
my_dict0 = dict(awesomeKeyName = "awesome value 0",)
my_dict1 = dict(
    awesomeKeyName = None,
    anotherAwesomeKeyName = "awesome value 1 for anotherAwesomeKeyName",
)
# merge the two dictionaries avoiding None values
my_merged_dict_1_overwrites_0_but_avoiding_nonetype = \
    {key: val for key, val in my_dict0.items() if val is not None} | \
    {key: val for key, val in my_dict1.items() if val is not None}
print(my_merged_dict_1_overwrites_0_but_avoiding_nonetype)
```

Perfect. Empty strings, boolean values, and everything else that isn't `Nonetype` is left alone.
But those pesky `None` values are tossed (along with their keys, if nothing other than `Nonetype` values are present).

#### Make it reusable
```python
def merge_without_none(lhs: dict, rhs: dict) -> dict:
    """Merge lhs and rhs dictionaries, excluding from both and 
    avoiding overwriting lhs with Nonetype values."""
    return {key: val for key, val in lhs.items() if val is not None} | \
    {key: val for key, val in rhs.items() if val is not None}

assert "test val" in merge_without_none(
    {"testKey": "test val"}, 
    {"testKey": None},
).get("testKey")
assert not merge_without_none(
    {"testKey": None},
    {"testKey": None},
).get("testKey")
```

> I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to _properly_ type the `lhs` and `rhs`.

### Putting it all together

Let's back up to our `PaymentFeatures` class from before and use it to merge two
of them that we instantiate.

#### Instantiate our `PaymentFeatures` objects

We'll rely on the `.dict()` method from Pydantic, as mentioned above.
```python
# instantiate the objects
pf0 = PaymentFeatures(
    myParam=42,
    myOtherParam="Is the meaning of life",
)
pf1 = PaymentFeatures(
    myParam=42,
    myOtherParam=None,
)
```

#### Merge the dictionaries

Let's use our sparklin' new function and combine the two, keeping `"Is the meaning of life"`
```python
pf_merged = merge_without_none(
    pf0.dict(),
    pf1.dict(),
)
```

_Remember that the `pf0` and `pf1` objects we used are Pydantic models so convert them to dictionaries prior to merging!_

#### Gotchas

Recall that the ordinary Python "merge" methods always rewrite keys present in both the
left-hand-side and right-hand-side with the right-hand-side values. 

That means that if we add something besides a `None` value to `pf1`'s `myOtherParam` attribute,
we should expect the `merge_without_none` function to overwrite the `myOtherParam` value
from `pf0`.

## Summary 

To summarize, we
- reviewed the standard way to merge two dictionaries in Python 3.9 via 
the newfangled union operator, 
- showed a simple dictionary comprehension method to merge and avoid `None` values ,
- added the method to a reusable function, and
- used that function with Pydantic models, as a toy, but real-world example.
