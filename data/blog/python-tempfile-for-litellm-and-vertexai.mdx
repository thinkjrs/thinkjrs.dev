I previously [wrote about authenticating Google Cloud services](/blog/gcp-auth-with-custom-credentials) with a custom `Credentials` object from their auth library.

This is a follow-up on how I use that with the remarkable [LiteLLM](https://litellm.vercel.app) library to query Google's Vertex AI endpoints, using the `tempfile` module available in Python.

## Motivation

As highlighted in my auth article, it is generally unsafe to store your service accounts on disk for deployed services.

The good news is that Python has a module called [`tempfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#examples) you can use to create temporary files and directories that disappear after their context is over.

> Yes, you should use context managers in Python. Here's some [candy from the official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) on `with` statements.

## Digging in 

Let's install dependencies and then go through each section of the code.

### Dependencies 

Install the following dependencies:

```
pip install litellm google-cloud-aiplatform
```

### Add the imports

We'll need to use `tempfile`, `os`, and `litellm`. Let's import those.

```python
import tempfile
import os
import litellm
litellm.vertex_project = "blah"
litellm.vertex_location = "us-central1"
```

While we're at it we also set some requirements for LiteLLM we'll need later. Make sure your GCP project and location are what you have in your project.

### Using `tempfile`

The tempfile module "creates temporary files and directories." It works on all platforms and provides context managers to securely destroy leftovers outside of the temporary file or directory context.

Here, we run our code logic in the context of the temporary directory and credentials file created within it.

```python
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_directory:
```
Using the `with` directive to manage context, we create `temp_directory` leveraging the `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class. 

Next, we'll grab our JSON string and save it as a file inside `temp_directory`, making sure to record that path as `temp_file_path`.

```python
    service_account_json_string: str = (
        os.getenv("GCP_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS") or ""
    )
    temp_file_path = os.path.join(temp_directory, "service_account.json")
```

Lastly, we'll write that file to the temporary "disk" space we created.

```python
    # Write the JSON string to the temporary file
    with open(temp_file_path, "w") as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(service_account_json_string)
```

Now, we've got our credentials saved at the temporary file path, `temp_file_path`.

### Calling the model

To use our credentials and call the model we need to set that file path to an environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. 

```python
    # Set the LiteLLM environment variable https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/providers/vertex
    os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = temp_file_path
```

Now we can call our model, which is super simple with the LiteLLM library.

```python
    # Call the model which creates a Credential object using Google auth under the hood within LiteLLM
    response = litellm.completion(
        model="gemini-pro",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "write me a joke about linkedin legends",
            }
        ],
    )
    # "Why did the LinkedIn legend get lost in the woods?"
    # "Because they were too busy posting about their 'hustle' and 'grind' to pay attention to where they were going."
```

Voilà!

## The full code 

Here's the full snippet you can copy-pasta to get up and running very
quickly.

```python
import tempfile
import os
import litellm
litellm.vertex_project = "blah"
litellm.vertex_location = "us-central1"

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_directory:
    service_account_json_string: str = (
        os.getenv("GCP_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS") or ""
    )
    temp_file_path = os.path.join(temp_directory, "service_account.json")

    # Write the JSON string to the temporary file
    with open(temp_file_path, "w") as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(service_account_json_string)

    # Set the LiteLLM environment variable https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/providers/vertex
    os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = temp_file_path
    
    # Call the model which creates a Credential object using Google auth under the hood within LiteLLM
    response = litellm.completion(
        model="gemini-pro",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "write me a joke about linkedin legends",
            }
        ],
    )
```
## In summary

Hopefully this clarified how to save Google application credentials into a temporary file safely.

Normally, at my firm [Tincre](https://tincre.com), we leverage custom credentials objects for GCP services but LiteLLM doesn't yet support this. I have an [open PR ready for merging](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/2463) to make this happen.
