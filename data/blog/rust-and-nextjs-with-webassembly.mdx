Performance in web applications is a pre-conditioned expectation from users
in modern user interfaces. Unfortunately, for some types of application
functionality, we're left with slow and hardly-usable functionality
when implementing those in JavaScript alone.

Fortunately, we have a wonderful technology called WebAssembly which
all major browsers support, as of 2025. This technology is a low-level,
binary instruction format designed to run programs efficiently, complementing JavaScript.

WebAssembly serves as a portable compilation target for high-level programming
languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling programs to run at
near-native speed in a browser. 

If this feels like the future, you’re already living it.

## General project setup

We need to build our Next.js app and then somehow call our Rust functions.

Here's how we'll knock that out:

1. Create the project using `create-next-app`
2. Write the Rust library crate
3. Build the Rust library
4. Add a React component to call our Rust library
5. Add some interface sugar
6. Grab a tasty beer, coffee or bland glass of water

### Create our app

Hop over to your terminal and let's create our app.

```sh
npx create-next-app
```

Follow the prompts using the defaults - app directory, tailwind, eslint,
typescript, default module paths and avoid turbopack.

I named the app `next-wasm-rust` - you can name it whatever you want.

## Using Rust in Next.js

Now it's time to create the Rust portion of our app that will calculate
fibonacci numbers.

Unfortunately, getting a setup that will work well in modern React
and Next.js is somewhat dificult.

### `wasm-bindgen` to the rescue

For our purposes, we will use a fantastic tool called `wasm-bindgen`,
which is a Rust library and toolchain that facilitates the interoperability
between Rust and JavaScript (and other WebAssembly host environments).

In short, it helps us write WebAssembly modules in Rust and interact with
JavaScript code seamlessly.

> There are other methods to interface with WebAssembly modules, however, I
> was entirely unable to get anything else working with the Next.js app router
> and Webpack 5.

### Building the Rust `fibonacci` lib

Inside of our Next.js app, use cargo to create the library.

```rust
cargo new fibonacci --lib
```

And now add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "fibonacci"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

Notice our dependencies and crate-type. These are critical.

### Recursive `fibonacci`

If you're familiar with the Fibonacci problem set from your algorithms
courses, throw away all that matrix and other goodness for now. We're trying
to calculate this slowly, to show how powerful WASM can be!

In your `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = fibonacci(0);
        assert_eq!(result, 0);
    }
}
```

Okay, save that file and make sure everything runs.

```sh
cargo test
```

### Building our library

Now we'll use the `wasm-pack` tool to build our library for use in our Next.js
application.

Simply execute the following from within your `fibonacci` Rust library.

```sh
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../src/app/pkg
```

We are telling `wasm-pack` to output the build into our `app` directory
for our Next.js application. This is important.

> You can get [wasm-pack here](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) if needed.

Now you should have a directory in `src/app/` named `pkg` containing the following:

```sh
src/app/pkg
├── fibonacci.d.ts
├── fibonacci.js
├── fibonacci_bg.wasm
├── fibonacci_bg.wasm.d.ts
└── package.json
```

#### Add a build command to `package.json` for your Next.js app

Now let's add a build command to our `package.json` so that we
don't have to rock this over and over.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build:fibonacci": "cd fibonacci && wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../src/app/pkg && cd -",
    "build": "yarn build:fibonacci && next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
```

Lastly, update your eslint configuration file to avoid some TypeScript errors
over which we have no control:

```js
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"),
  // WASM-specific rule adjustments
  {
    files: ["src/app/pkg/fibonacci.js"],
    rules: {
      "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off",
    },
  },
];
```

## Add the `Fibonacci` component

Now it's time to build the actual component we'll call in our
page rendering.

I like to put all my components in their own directory:

```sh
mkdir src/components
```

And then name the component `Fibonacci.tsx`. This will all run in the
browser so make sure to put the `use client` directive at the top.

```ts
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import type { InitInput, InitOutput } from "@/app/pkg/fibonacci";
import init from "@/app/pkg/fibonacci";
```

We'll need a few imports so make sure you've added those in the steps above.

Next up is creating our WebAssembly object:

```ts
const WebAssembly = {
  fibonacci: null as ((n: number) => number) | null,
  init: async (input?: InitInput): Promise<void> => {
    const wasm: InitOutput = await init(input);
    WebAssembly.fibonacci = wasm.fibonacci;
  },
};
```

We'll call this later, having stored initialized functionality on this
object. Now let's add the component itself.

```tsx
export default function Fibonacci() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [fibonacciInput, setFibonacciInput] = useState<number | null>(null);
  return null;
}
```

We'll need to store the result of the fibonacci call in `result` and
we'll take some user input for which fibonacci number to calculate, storing
that as well.

> This is called a controlled input in React lingo.

Now let's update the `null` return value. We'll add some functions to call our
`fibonacci` function shortly.

```tsx
<div>
  <h2 className="text-sm/6 font-medium text-gray-400">
    Calculate a fibonacci number
  </h2>
  <div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 sm:gap-x-6 gap-y-4 sm:gap-y-0">
    <input
      type="number"
      onChange={(e) => setFibonacciInput(parseInt(e.currentTarget.value))}
      className="w-full px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-100 focus:bg-indigo-50 text-indigo-950 border rounded-md focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500"
    />
    <button
      type="button"
      className="rounded-md bg-indigo-500 px-3 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-indigo-400 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-indigo-500 sm:w-1/2"
      onClick={() =>
        typeof fibonacciInput === "number"
          ? handleFibonacciCalculation(fibonacciInput)
          : null
      }
    >
      Get result
    </button>
    <p className="mt-4">
      <span className="text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-white">
        {typeof result === "number" ? result.toLocaleString() : null}
      </span>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Okay, now we need to add the `handleFibonacciCalculation` function and
another one to initialize the WebAssembly setup.

In the body of your function add the script that will load the wasm module:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadWasm() {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      await WebAssembly.init();
    }
  }
  loadWasm();
}, []);
```

Then add the handler we call when the user clicks "Get result":

```tsx
const handleFibonacciCalculation = (value: number) => {
  if (WebAssembly.fibonacci) {
    const computedResult = WebAssembly.fibonacci(value);
    setResult(computedResult);
  } else {
    console.error("WASM module is not initialized.");
  }
};
```

The full setup should look like this:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import type { InitInput, InitOutput } from "@/app/pkg/fibonacci";
import init from "@/app/pkg/fibonacci";

const WebAssembly = {
  fibonacci: null as ((n: number) => number) | null,
  init: async (input?: InitInput): Promise<void> => {
    const wasm: InitOutput = await init(input);
    WebAssembly.fibonacci = wasm.fibonacci;
  },
};
export default function Fibonacci() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [fibonacciInput, setFibonacciInput] = useState<number | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadWasm() {
      if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
        await WebAssembly.init();
      }
    }
    loadWasm();
  }, []);

  const handleFibonacciCalculation = (value: number) => {
    if (WebAssembly.fibonacci) {
      const computedResult = WebAssembly.fibonacci(value);
      setResult(computedResult);
    } else {
      console.error("WASM module is not initialized.");
    }
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h2 className="text-sm/6 font-medium text-gray-400">
        Calculate a fibonacci number
      </h2>
      <div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 sm:gap-x-6 gap-y-4 sm:gap-y-0">
        <input
          type="number"
          onChange={(e) => setFibonacciInput(parseInt(e.currentTarget.value))}
          className="w-full px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-100 focus:bg-indigo-50 text-indigo-950 border rounded-md focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500"
        />
        <button
          type="button"
          className="rounded-md bg-indigo-500 px-3 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-indigo-400 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-indigo-500 sm:w-1/2"
          onClick={() =>
            typeof fibonacciInput === "number"
              ? handleFibonacciCalculation(fibonacciInput)
              : null
          }
        >
          Get result
        </button>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <span className="text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-white">
            {typeof result === "number" ? result.toLocaleString() : null}
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now we're ready to actually use the `Fibonacci` component which
calls a Rust function to calculate fibonacci numbers.

## Use the `Fibonacci` component

In your `src/app/page.tsx` file, add the component.

```tsx
import Fibonacci from "@/components/Fibonacci";
...
<ol>
    ...
    <li>Save and see your changes instantly.</li>
</ol>
<Fibonacci />
...
```

I added mine right after the `ol` component - feel free to change this
to whatever you like.

Now fire up your dev server and start calculating some fibonacci numbers!

Start with 42, that is large enough to not be instantaneous.

### P.S. Why not use a faster Fibonacci algorithm?

Great question. Obviously we can all implement the matrix exponentiation version in our heads
so why rock the slow and memory-hungry recursive version?

Simple. I intentionally want to experience the speed of the Rust algorithm!

### P.P.S. The code

Check out the [corresponding Github repo](https://github.com/thinkjrs/nextjs-wasm-bindgen) that has this code in it. It's MIT, so feel free to use at-will and contribute, if that's how you roll.
