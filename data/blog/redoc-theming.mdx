Wait, you don't know what redoc is? What APIs are? You don't use Swagger? This article might not be for
you.{' '}

**I will avoid defining those things so that I have more material to blabber about later. üòâ**

But if you do use OpenAPI (Swagger) definitions for your APIs, you should be using
redoc to publish and beautify your definitions. And even better, once you hit scale,
you can leverage the company behind the redoc project - Redocly - to manage that
scale.

<div className="px-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
  {`Of course I have literally nothing to do with Redocly, nor do I even know
  anyone who works there (at least of whom I'm aware). I just genuinely enjoy
  great products and the businesses that make them.`}
  <span className="font-bold">{` Big surprise, considering we (try)
  to do the same thing at `}</span>

## üìö What is redoc?

### What we need it for

For Tincre's developer platform, [Tincre.dev](https://tincre.dev), we need to publish various API documentation so that other developers can best understand how to use
our products and services. Believe it or not, this is no easy task.

For one, _just look at how much detail is in a single [API schema for our Promo API](https://tincre.dev/docs/reference)!_ In case you're wondering what that API does _IRL_, head over to one of our product subsidiaries, [b00st.com](https://b00st.com), login and
press the "Real Easy Ads" button. The Promo API is the magic behind the scenes, running may of the largest musicians' and bands' marketing ü§Ø

#### Getting setup

#### Theming it purdy

## üìë Why Tincre needs API docs

Phil and I built this business to scale, at extremely low costs, with pure blood,
sweat and tears.

That scale starts _now_. Actually it started many months ago and we've been
maintaining a 5-15% top-line growth rate monthly. Oh, and there's been no sacrificing
earnings - profitabilty has also expanded while
growing that top line. Cash flows? _Fuggedaboutit!_

### Imminent expansion - tincre.dev

Specifically, we're working with some amazing partner firms you'll see announced over
the next several months to plug in our new [Promo](https://tincre.dev/promo) product.

Then, we'll begin marketing our fully-fledged developer platform to well, developers. But developers are, by far, the hardest and most expensive group of customers/clients you can go after. It's the pinnacle of business in 2022 (and has been for quite a while).

But don't take my word for it...Amazon, for instance, generated **more than half its 2021 profits** via
its AWS - Amazon Web Services - business, which sells specifically to developers and
developer-enabled organizations.

Businesses such as Twilio, Facebook (Meta), Mailchimp, and Ebay, to name a few, either sell developers services directly or rely
upon developer-built consumer-facing technologies for _literally all of their cash flows_.

### Communication, service, and support

But as a small operation which has rejected VC funding up to this point, we have to
attack our market from a different, vastly more efficient angle.

That's where our API (and other) docs come into play. High-quality engineering communication
with our developer client base is paramount to successful products and services.

#### Keeping ourselves honest

By publishing code-side documentation that's generated from our actual APIs we are
able to communicate with our clients in ways the old-school business world cannot begin
to fathom.

For example, imagine that the second your favorite restaurant changed the recipe to a menu
item that you were:

1. informed of the change,
2. were told exactly what that would mean for other dishes on the menu, and
3. were able to make an informed decision _before_ ordering that dish, surprised by the abrupt difference.

#### New capabilities for client developers

Quality technical documentation also communicates _how_ to utilize something. You'll notice that each of our API endpoints in the redoc rendering has a `Response` demonstration.

Hit the API as one of our client developers and know _exactly what you're going to get and how you're going to get it_.

#### Business efficiency: a first line of defense

Lastly, quality docs are an efficiency tool for a business like ours. They're the first
order of assistance we can provide, helping to clarify usage, expectations, limitations,
and most importantly, possibilities.
