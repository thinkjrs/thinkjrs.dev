I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you and everyone else you're going to meet and already have will die. Yes, I know, that's harsh. But I continue to witness the _degradation of the doers_ in advanced economies, as software like mine continues [to eat the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). We live in a production scale meets consumption scale economy.

It is only natural that many choose to ride waves, a.k.a. "surfing". Afterall, as we devs construct and improve
paradigms for people to "get shit done" we inherently make it vastly easier for just a few to 
get a whole lot more done, effectively crowding-out larger majorities creating, quickly.

help people scale their consumption of the above said "shit" which just a few are creating,
but with ever-more ease to actually commit the act of consumption.
