Authenticating with Google Cloud can be straightforward when using a notebook or a Virtual Machine. However, for those developing production software for the web, authentication poses more challenges. For reasons beyond the scope of this discussion, loading a file from disk in production web environments is typically not viable and can be very unsafe.

> The White House recently [issued a report](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/03/04/in-rust-we-trust-white-house-office-urges-memory-safety/) urging the world to stop using "dangerous" languages because pointers can overflow. I'd hate to see how scared they'd be if they understood container layers and credentials stored on disk...

## GCP auth in Python

Let's say we want to use the Vertex AI apis to call Google's new Gemini Pro endpoint. Let's assume you downloaded a service account from your cloud platform
project in GCP. And let's assume you store _the contents of that file in an environment variable_ `GCP_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS`.

### The docs 

- [Google Auth](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-auth/latest/index.html)
- [Google Auth custom credentials](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-auth/latest/user-guide.html#service-account-private-key-files)
- [Vertex AI quick start](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#send-request)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-auth google-cloud-aiplatform
```

### Import the stuff

```python
import json
import os
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
```

### Create your credentials object 
```python
service_account_info_json = json.loads(
  os.getenv('GCP_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS')
)
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
  service_account_info_json
)
```

As mentioned previously the `GCP_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` variable holds the string value of the service account. 

> This is different from standard `APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` usage which holds a string path to your service account file.

In the code above, we use the `os` module to load the environment variable and pass its contents to the `json.loads` method. This converts the JSON string into a dictionary containing our service account values.

We then pass those to the `from_service_account_info` method of the `Credentials` class from the `google.oauth2` `service_account` module.

### Call the Vertex AI endpoint
Next all we have to do is initialize the `vertexai` module by calling its `init` method. 

```python
# your project name is not 'blah'
vertexai.init(project='blah', location='us-central1', credentials=credentials)
```
And then we are rocking to call the model at will. Here's an example with the prompt 

```
"Tell me a joke about a guy named Johnny Rocket",
```

```python
# Load the model
multimodal_model = GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
# Query the model
response = multimodal_model.generate_content(
    [
        "Tell me a joke about a guy named Johnny Rocket",
    ]
)
print(response)
# the text response from the model is in the parameter `text`, i.e. `response.text`
```

### All the code
And so you have it, here's the complete code.

```python
import json
import os
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

service_account_info_json = json.loads(os.getenv('GCP_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS'))
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(service_account_info_json)

vertexai.init(project='blah', location='us-central1', credentials=credentials)
# Load the model
multimodal_model = GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
# Query the model
response = multimodal_model.generate_content(
    [
        "Tell me a joke about a guy named Johnny Rocket",
    ]
)
print(response)
```

> As an aside, if you use containers don't forget to remove this variable in test builds so that you don't have that service account laying around!

## In summary

I hope this helped someone out there authenticate safely using Google Cloud service accounts. We use this strategy for all our GCP interactions off-platform and it's very reliable and safer than leaving a file hanging out in the open.
