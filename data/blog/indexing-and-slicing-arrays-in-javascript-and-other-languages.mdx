Indexing and slicing arrays are some of the most basic tasks in programming.
Almost all programming
languages have the ability to index and arrays, including both static and dynamic
languages like Python (dynamic), JavaScript (dynamic), C++ (static) and Go (static).

🧑‍💻 Grab the code to follow along via my [Github](https://github.com/thinkjrs/thinkjrs.dev/), available in the `example-code` directory.

## Array indexing syntax in C++, Python, and JavaScript
In many languages array indexing 
looks something like the Python code below.

```python
>>> myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexes']
>>> print(myArray[0])
testing
```

In C++ _indexing_ the array looks the same as the Python above, though the other
parts are different.

```cpp
// myArray.cpp
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::array<std::string, 3> myArray = {"testing", "array", "indexes"};
    std::cout << myArray[0] << "\n";
}
```

See how the indexing portion `myArray[0]` is the same?

Now compile that C++ code and run it:
```bash 
c++ myArray.cpp && ./a.out
testing
```

And yet again, the code below looks pretty much the same as Python, but now in JavaScript. 

```js 
let myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexes']
console.log(myArray[0])
testing
```

So to summarize _indexing_ `myArray` in all three languages:

- Python: `myArray[0]`,
- C++: `myArray[0]`, and
- JavaScript: `myArray[0]`.

🤯

### Static versus dynamic

You probably noticed that JavaScript and Python look quite alike, even for the
initialization
of `myArray`, whereas C++ looks quite different. That's because the former are _dynamic_
programming languages while the latter is a static, compiled language.

The "debate" or merits of one over the other aren't for this write-up; we'll save that
for later, after your author is retired or rocking a CS PhD. 
For now, since this article is _mostly_ about JavaScript, we'll stick to dynamic languages.

### Other ways to index JavaScript arrays

What's neat about JavaScript is that the `Array` built-in has
another way to index arrays, using the `at` method.

```javascript
let myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexing']
console.log(myArray.at(0))
"testing"
```

Why is this useful? Well imagine that you don't want to risk doing something like
the below happening.

```javascript
let myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexing']
console.log(myArray[5])
undefined
```

JavaScript's `Array.at()` method will return a `-1` value for an index not in the
array, rather than undefined. This can be very useful for build-in sorting methods.

## Grabbing a "slice"
While we're at it, how would one go about getting several pieces of an 
array at once? As in, get both values `"array"` and `"indexing"` from `myArray`? 

Fortunately JavaScript's language gods have a nice, prepackaged answer for you: slicing.

```javascript
let myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexing']
myArray.slice(0, 1)
```

Many other dynamic languages have this feature, too. In Python it's built right into the core
of its "array" ([list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#list)). It's so common in modern languages that Go makes _slices_ built-in:, e.g.

```go
// slices.go 

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	myArray := [3]string{"testing", "array", "indexes"}

	var s []string = myArray[0:1]
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```

In the code above `myArray` is called a _slice_ and used similarly to an array in JavaScript
or list in Python.

## Doing things with arrays and slicing

So let's put some of this to use, in JavaScript, of course. Why don't we
write a simple function that "chunks" some data for another function? 

In particular, let's dig into the `disectChartData` function from [@Tincre's Promo dashboard](https://github.com/Tincre/promo-dashboard/blob/029dae1b4f146879329116d2fc4de951f4ed15d9/src/lib/disectChartData.ts)
library.

> _Note, that library function is written in TypeScript but I've converted it to JavaScript here._

```JavaScript
/**
 * @description Given a Chart.js label array and a Chart.js data array and an
 * integer length, return an object of those labels and data arrays sliced up
 * to the ending lengths.
 *
 * @param { Array<string | null> }labels string labels to index data
 * @param { Array<string | number | null> } data data to plot 
 * @param { number } length length to slice _from the end of each array_
 *
 * @returns an object of sliced labels and data
 */
function disectChartData(labels, data, length) {
  const endLabelSliceIdx = labels.length;
  const endDataSliceIdx = data.length;
  const startLabelIdx = Math.max(0, endLabelSliceIdx - length);
  const startDataIdx = Math.max(0, endDataSliceIdx - length);
  return {
    labels: labels.slice(startLabelIdx, endLabelSliceIdx),
    data: data.slice(startDataIdx, endDataSliceIdx),
  };
}
```

The function above is called when a user selects a time span in our
apps' dashboards, like "1-month". It should return the latest data 
for a 1-month (30 day) time horizon.

As you can see, slicing comes in very handy here. If we didn't have slices, 
the function would need to loop through the given arrays, copy over the values
and send back new arrays. 

By using slicing we're able to send back a reference to the original array,
saving memory and execution time. ⏩️

### Extra credit, C++ and Python

Since I have been referencing other language syntax throughout this piece, let's 
look at "slicing" in Python and C++. 

> To refresh your memory, Python's a dynamic language and C++ is a static language!

#### Python

Python has slicing built right into its list type. Let's take a look, below.
```python
>>> myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexes']
>>> print(myArray[0:1])
['testing']
```

Cool, right? You, the venerable programmer, can avoid typing out `slice` or something like that!

#### C++ 

First of all, we're going to skip over a bunch of more complex stuff and switch from `std::array`
to using [`std::vector`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector). That's because the C++ Standard Library's Vector class allows us
to use things like slicing, also built-in (though slightly different, since it's a static language).

```cpp
// vectorSlice.cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> myArray = {"testing", "array", "indexes"};
    auto myArraySlice = std::vector<std::string>(
        myArray.begin(), myArray.end() - 1,
    );
    std::cout << myArraySlice[0] << "\n";
}
```

Compile and run it:

```bash
c++ vectorSlice.cpp && ./a.out
testing
```

## Watch out for index bounds! 

Now back to JavaScript. An easy mistake to make is to
write a function like `disectChartData` above and feed it
your array indexes for slicing. 

As an example, let's think of a three element array of strings, e.g. 

```javascript
let myArray = ['testing', 'array', 'indexes']
```

And a simple function to return slices of a given array, e.g.

```javascript
/**
 * @description Return the sliced array given the start and ending indexes
 * 
 * @param { number } start the index from which to slice
 * @param { number } end the index to which to slice
 * @param { Array } arr an array of things
 * 
 * @returns { Array } stuff
 */
function getSlice(start, end, arr) {
    return arr.slice(start, end) 
}
```

Now you might think that calling the function with `getSlice(0, 2, myArray)` would give:

```javascript
//[myArray[0], myArray[1], myArray[2]]
['testing', 'array', 'indexes']
```
But be careful, as array slicing in JavaScript is different
that indexing! 

To get all three elements you want to call the function with `getSlice(0, 3, myArray)`.

## In summary 

In this piece I drove you around a couple of different programming language array
neighborhoods.

Those included

- Python,
- C++,
- Go, and 
- JavaScript.

We briefly mentioned that static and dynamic languages are different types of languages
and then dug into slicing -- getting a subset of an array. Then we applied slicing arrays in JavaScript, used in the real-world [Promo dashboard library](https://github.com/Tincre/promo-dashboard). Lastly, I demonstrated a pitfall you might encounter using slices versus array indexing.
