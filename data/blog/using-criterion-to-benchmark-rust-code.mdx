The Rust ecosystem has a great tool for benchmarking [Criterion.rs](https://docs.rs/criterion/latest/criterion/index.html), ported from Haskell.

Let's fire up a small test case and discover a few things we can do with it.

## What we're going to benchmark

In solving something this week I had to break down an integer into its digits. Of course, we can always use the base and divide; however, when writing this, I longed for something more idiomatic to the language.

You know, something functional with iterators and all that - because that's how we Rustaceans rock! That said, I was also curious as to the overhead that this introduced, versus the arithmetic solution.

### Breaking down digits

- The arithmetic solution:

  ```rust
  pub fn get_digits_arithmetic(mut n: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
      let mut digits = Vec::new();
      while n > 0 {
          digits.push(n % 10);
          n /= 10;
      }
      digits.reverse();
      digits
  }
  ```

- The idiomatic version:

  ```rust
  pub fn get_digits_idiomatic(mut n: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
      std::iter::from_fn(|| {
          if n > 0 {
              let digit = n % 10;
              n /= 10;
              Some(digit)
          } else {
              None
          }
      })
      .collect::<Vec<_>>()
      .into_iter()
      .rev()
      .collect()
  }
  ```

Now we should test these and make sure they work before moving on.

#### Super simple unit tests

We'll do this right in our `lib.rs` file.

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn get_digits_arithmetic_works() {
        let result = get_digits_arithmetic(20);
        assert_eq!(result, vec![2, 0]);
    }

    #[test]
    fn get_digits_idiomatic_works() {
        let result = get_digits_idiomatic(20);
        assert_eq!(result, vec![2, 0]);
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¥ `cargo test` passes like a charm.

## Using criterion

To use `criterion.rs` we need to add a `benches` directory and a `benchmark.rs` file inside of it, plus a `[[bench]]` directive in our `Cargo.toml`.

Once we've got these we can rock `cargo bench` and get some stats on our functions above.

### `benchmark.rs`

So assuming the functions above are public, we can use the following to do statistical runtime comparison of the two functions.

```rust
use criterion::{black_box, criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};
use criterion_benchmarks::{get_digits_arithmetic, get_digits_idiomatic};

fn benchmark_digits(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let test_number = 123456789;

    // Benchmark the arithmetic implementation
    c.bench_function("get_digits_arithmetic", |b| {
        b.iter(|| get_digits_arithmetic(black_box(test_number)))
    });

    // Benchmark the idiomatic implementation
    c.bench_function("get_digits_idiomatic", |b| {
        b.iter(|| get_digits_idiomatic(black_box(test_number)))
    });
}

criterion_group!(benches, benchmark_digits);

criterion_main!(benches);
```

Here I've named my crate `criterion_benchmarks` - use whatever you rocked when running `cargo new --lib` prior.

### Update `Cargo.toml`

Now add the `[[bench]]` setup we need:

```toml
[[bench]]
name = "benchmark"
harness = false
```

And the library itself under `dev-dependencies`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = { version = "0.4", features = ["html_reports"] }
```
> We'll use the HTML report feature soon!

### Benchmark your heart out

Now we can run our benchmarks with `cargo bench`. You should get something that looks similar to the following:

```zsh
âžœ  criterion_benchmarks git:(main) âœ— cargo bench
   Compiling criterion_benchmarks v0.1.0 (/Users/thinkjrs/repos/learning-rust/criterion_benchmarks)

                        Performance has regressed.

```

Sweet, eh?

## Visualizations and tracking

One of the awesome features of `criterion.rs` is that the benchmarks are tracked _and_ you can visualize them. I believe they call this "batteries included!"

The killer feature here is that these are already done for you. On most systems, simply run the following to open your browser with the report:

```sh
open target/criterion/report/index.html
```

### Baselines for tracking

Another amazing feature is the ability to set a baseline against which to measure. Practically, letâ€™s set a baseline to main for measuring feature performance. Sounds reasonable, no?


```sh
git checkout main
cargo bench -- --save-baseline main
```

```sh
git checkout feature/amazing-new-optimization
cargo bench -- --save-baseline feature/amazing-new-optimization
```

Then run your benches as normal. And compare them with:

```sh
cargo bench -- --load-baseline new --baseline main
```

Sick, no?

## Summing it all up

Benchmarking in Rust is incredibly easy with `criterion.rs`.

**Some highlights:**
â€¢ Easy Setup: A quick addition to your Cargo.toml and benches directory gets you started.
â€¢ Detailed Analysis: Criterion provides time measurements, performance regression checks, and outlier detection.
â€¢ Visualizations: Automatically generated HTML reports let you track and compare benchmarks in a user-friendly format.
â€¢ Baselines: Save and compare results across branches or optimizations, enabling informed decisions about performance improvements.

Now you can ninja-tune your Rust code and feel like a real pro. LFG! ðŸš€
