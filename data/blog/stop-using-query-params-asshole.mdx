## Query params in 2022 are not secure

In modern web engineering it is quite common to build sites, apps, and API
services with query parameters.

## WTF are query params, anyways? 

Okay, so you're reading this, aren't a developer, and are completely confused as to what the hell it is I'm talking about when you read **_query parameters_**.

Simply, a **query parameter** are pieces of data encoded into the URL; yes, that one you click on or go to via your URL bar in your browser. 

Let's see an example (that doesn't do anything!):

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string?a=QueryParam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string?a=QueryParam). 

Query params are the part _after_ the `?`; in this instance, the variable `a` is equal to the value `QueryParam`. 

> üå∂Ô∏è The part before the `?` is called the _path component_ of a URL.

## Security of query parameters

Query parameters are part of nearly every website and app on the web, including
ours at [Tincre](https://tincre.com). That said, not all are created equal and most are not insecure _by nature_ though often screw over users _in aggregate_.

The reasons for this are simple. First, let's dig into some background.

### Your browser

Your browser typically keeps a history of the URLs that you visit, even if you delete on close, for some amount of time. And no, you really can't keep them 
from doing so; you also don't want to stop them. If you did, the back button 
wouldn't work.

### Your network (wifi, typically)

Furthermore, if you're connected to the internet you're connected to that
_through a network_. And the administer of that network can and does see 
the URLs you visit, including query parameters.

Yes you read that correctly - your Google search for ["Lana Del Rey"](https://www.lanadelrey.com/) was seen by your work IT department. It probably caused them to pre-order her next album, due out on March 10th, 2023.

What happens online doesn't exactly stay online...

### Extensions + programs on your device

Though many browsers are "sandboxed" for security, there are ways to read
the basic url history while your browser is open, from within the browser, as 
an extension, or from another program on your device. 

Sound creepy? Not quite: like the back button, you likely _rely upon_ this 
capability for basic usage of the internet. For example, I like to use 
a password manager to store and randomly generate passwords for sites. My password manager could not function if I did not allow it to read my 
internet history within my browser. As such, I not only willingly allow this,
I require it.

That said, I'm a developer and use an open-source password manager; I've
actually done a code review on that app and _I know it is not shipping my browser history to a third party_. But unless you're a developer and you happen to have a usable end-user application that is open source (very, very rare), you 
aren't going to be able to verify the safety of such an application or extension.

Use an ad blocker? Same deal. That wouldn't work without access to the URLs you visit.

## Browser, networks, and extensions, oh my!

Your browser history, the network you're on, and your browser extensions + device applications all have or leave some or partial access to the URLs you visit.

That includes the query parameters in those urls. So think about it: if a developer uses a query parameter that contains something important -- like your email -- that developer has potentially introduced a security and privacy risk on the user's behalf! How kind!
