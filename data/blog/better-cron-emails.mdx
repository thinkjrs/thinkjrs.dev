In assuming you run [`cron`](https://habilis.net/cronic/) jobs all the time, on all your systems,
like I do, you've probably set the crontab options or the `MAILTO` variable within `/etc/crontab`
configuration file or utilized stderr and stdout redirects.

## _There is a better way!_

Meet [`Cronic`](https://habilis.net/cronic/), a
shell script by Chuck Houpt

> to help control the most annoying feature of cron: unwanted emailed output,
> or 'cram' (cron spam).

### Basic Usage

Instead of writing:

```cron
* * * * * myscript >/dev/null 2>&1
```

you can now write:

```cron
* * * * * cronic myscript
```

You can avoid sweeping all cron errors under the
rug, as we do with stderr and stdout redirection to the `/dev/null` black hole
while simultaneously cleaning up the readability of your scripts.

### Get it on Github

The Cronic script is available on Github via the community here: [justincase/cronic](https://github.com/justincase/cronic). That version is v2 and I've submitted a [PR to upgrade things to v3](https://github.com/justincase/cronic/pull/2).

**If you need v3 now, fork my copy at [thinkjrs/cronic](https://github.com/thinkjrs/cronic/tree/master).**

### Installation

If you're a familiar 'nix user just make the script executable and put it somewhere in your path.

#### 'Nix Scripting Step-by-step

For those readers less familiar with 'nix scripting, let's break down step by
step how to install Cronic.

Open up your terminal:

1. Clone the repo via `git clone git@github.com:thinkjrs/cronic`.
2. Change directories into the new repo directory `cd cronic`.
3. Make `cronic` executable via `chmod +x cronic`.
4. Make a `bin` directory in your user `$HOME` directory, i.e. `mkdir $HOME/bin` or `mkdir ~/bin`.
   > Don't worry, if you have a `bin` directory within your home directory already this will not overwrite it.
5. Make sure that `~/bin` is added to your path via `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.zsh_profile`, `.bashrc`, or whatever shell configuration files you use.

For example, on some systems I have the following in my `.bashrc`:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
... # more stuff added to the PATH
export PATH # now we export it to be used by the shell
```

6. Soft-link your executable cronic script to your `~/bin` directory. Assuming you're still in your cronic directory from Github (if not, navigate your shell there):

```bash
CRONIC_LOC=$(pwd)/cronic # set a temporary shell variable
pushd ~/bin # temporarily go into your ~/bin directory
ln -s $CRONIC_LOC cronic # create a soft-link _to_ the CRONIC_LOC named cronic
popd # return to your original cronic directory from Github
```

### 'Nix Extras

You might have noticed the use of `popd` and `pushd` above, in addition to
creating some `~/bin` directory for your user-space cronic script.

These are intentional as built-in programs and/or conventions commonly used in the GNU/Linux community.
