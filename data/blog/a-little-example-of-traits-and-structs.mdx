This post outlines a small example of using traits and structs. It's a simplified version of a chapter in my forthcoming book on Rust.

Let's use the `Anything` trait to store a `Star` in the `Universe`.

## `Universe` struct

We'll make ourselves a `Universe` struct with a single field, `things` that holds a dynamic number of objects.

The struct essentially serves as a container that can hold a collection of diverse objects, unified by the requirement that they implement the `Anything` trait. On `things` it uses a `Vec<Box<dyn Anything>>` to store these objects, leveraging Rustâ€™s dynamic dispatch to manage heterogeneity at runtime.

```rust
pub struct Universe {
    things: Vec<Box<dyn Anything>>,
}
```

### Adding some methods

Let's give our callers a simple API with things like `Universe::new`, `add_things` and `list_things`.

```rust
impl Universe {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Universe { things: Vec::new() }
    }

    pub fn add_things<T: Anything + 'static>(&mut self, thing: T) {
        self.things.push(Box::new(thing));
    }

    pub fn list_things(&self) -> Vec<String> {
        self.things.iter().map(|thing| thing.describe()).collect()
    }
}
```

Next we'll add our trait which allows for objects of different types to be stored dynamically on the heap at runtime.

## `Anything` trait

Our trait will have a single trait method `describe` that returns a string. This will require implementers to implement a `describe` method so we can do things like print out what is the type of the actual object.

```rust
pub trait Anything {
    fn describe(&self) -> String;
}
```

Now our callers can store literally anything in the `Universe` `things` field, as long as they implement `Anything`.

Next we'll take a look at how exactly to do that.

## Making a `Star`

First off we'll create a `Star` struct with a single field `name`.

```rust
struct Star {
    name: String,
}
```

And let's now give it the standard `new` interface.

```rust
impl Star {
    pub fn new(name: &str) -> Star {
        Star {
            name: name.to_string(),
        }
    }
}
```

Now let's implement the `Anything trait` for `Star` so we can store it in `Universe`.

```rust
impl Anything for Star {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}", self.name)
    }
}
```

Now we're ready to use all this. Let's create a `Universe` and add a `Star`!

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut universe = Universe::new();
    universe.add_things(Star::new("Olivia Rodgrido"));

    for description in universe.list_things() {
        println!("{}", description);
    }
}
```

Wait, you didn't think we were going to make a stellar body, did you?

## Recap

We first create some structs which help us group our data together. A `Universe` holds `things`, such as a `Star`. We could also create a struct `Mansion` with different properties from `Star`, such as `number_of_gardeners` and `cost_per_tennis_court`.

Because we implement the common trait `Anything` that makes sure our diverse types like `Star` and `Mansion` provide a `describe` method, they behave uniformly.

Using `Box<dyn Anything>` is used to enable dynamic dispatch, allowing our `Universe` collection to hold objects of different types, like `Star` and `Mansion`, that implement the same `Anything` trait.
