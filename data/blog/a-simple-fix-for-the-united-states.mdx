### The Overreach of the Executive Branch: A Call for Constitutional Amendments

In recent years, the executive branch of the U.S. federal government has amassed a level of power that I believe is excessively disproportionate. Both major political parties appear determined to continue expanding this power, raising concerns about the balance of our democratic system.

As a business owner, both on a small and large scale, Iâ€™ve experienced firsthand the detrimental effects of regulatory volatility in the United States. Historically, one of the most admirable aspects of the USA has been its capacity for meaningful change. However, the current trajectory seems to threaten this dynamism.

**Proposed Constitutional Amendments**

To address these issues, I propose an amendment to the Constitution that accomplishes two critical objectives:

1. **Restricting Governmental Control Over Prices**:
    This amendment should prohibit any branch of government, including the executive branch and state and local governments, from controlling the prices of goods, services, or any tradeable items. The only exception would be specifically-granted war-time powers. These powers, upon being granted by Congress (similar to current practices), would permit actions such as levying tariffs or instituting price controls. This would ensure that any intervention in the market is temporary and strictly regulated.

2. **Rewriting the Sherman Antitrust Act**:
    The Sherman Antitrust Act should be effectively rewritten to apply to the federal government. This rewrite would retain the "state action" doctrine, meaning that the federal government can only act anti-competitively when Congress has explicitly granted it the power to do so. This change would curb the federal government's ability to manipulate markets under the guise of competition regulation.

I lean libertarian, but with a pragmatic view that as people become wealthier, they naturally seek more government involvement. Government is indeed necessary for certain functions. However, we must scrutinize the extent of its control.

**The Illusion of Freedom**

In the United States, we frequently tout the value of freedom. But what freedom truly exists when a branch of government can arbitrarily dictate what you can or cannot sell, use, and at what prices and availability?

Consider the following restrictions imposed by our government:

- **Banning Specific Apps**: The outlawing of apps like TikTok.
- **Employment Regulation**: Federal-level minimum wage controls, which should be determined by states based on their unique economic conditions. Prices in New York City, NY, are vastly different from those in Butler, MO.
- **Industry Subsidies**: Government subsidies that favor certain industries, inherently disadvantaging others.
- **Trade Restrictions**: Tariffs impacting prices, such as those seen during the recent trade wars supported by both political parties.

**Conclusion**

We need to eliminate the hypocrisy from our political discourse and focus on issues that truly matter. The best government in the world is still your wallet. Let it sing, and remove the ability of politicians to control your behavior through economic manipulation.

By implementing these changes, we can restore a balance of power, reduce regulatory volatility, and uphold the freedoms that are fundamental to the American way of life. Let's strive for a government that empowers rather than controls, allowing individuals and businesses to thrive without undue interference.
