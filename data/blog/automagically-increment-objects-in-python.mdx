## [`collections.Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects)

The Python standard library's `collections` module offers datatype alternatives to the built-in
containers [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list), [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple), [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set), and [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict).

According to
[Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects)
, the [`Counter`]() `dict` subclass

> is provided to support convenient and rapid tallies.

In particular, `Counter` objects are absolutely fantastic at combining dictionary/map-like
objects with only numeric values.
You know, things like application metrics,
pipeline measurements during model training, and combining multiple disparate
samples into one.

### Digging into `Counter`

Fire up your Python console, import the `collections` module, and
instantiate a `Counter` object:

```python
import collections

my_piano_ballad_recordings = Counter({"Colder Weather": 2, "Mad World": 1})
```

Now you have a `Counter` object `my_piano_ballad_recordings` that holds
the song title as a string key and an integer _number of times the track has been recorded by you_. Feel free to modify for your own recordings!

Now let's say we just got a burst of inspiration and recorded another
take of Gary Jule's legendary _Mad World_. Add it and experience the magic of the `Counter` object.

```python
my_piano_ballad_recordings.update({"Colder Weather": 1})
```

Print that and you get something like:

```bash
Counter({"Colder Weather": 3, "Mad World": 1})
```

Notice how that _Colder Weather_ entry was updated automagically? In examining
the `main()` function within the `counter.py` file you can see that
the call to `update` above _doesn't wipe out the previous entries_, opposite of
the behavior of a traditional Python `dict` dictionary.

#### Converting back to regular dictionaries

A particularly amazing feature of the `Counter` object is that it can be
converted to a dictionary almost effortlessly.

```python
my_dict = dict(my_piano_ballad_recordings)
```

Say for example that you'd like to send everything in your counter to an
HTTP consumer. Simply convert to a `dict` and rock the `json` module like usual:

```python
import json
my_dict = dict(my_piano_ballad_recordings)
my_json = json.dumps(my_dict)
```

> You can add custom encoders here too; see [Making Python Classes JSON Serializable](https://slightlysharpe.com/blog/making-python-classes-json-serializable) for an overview.

#### All the other cool `dict` stuff is built-in

Because `Counter` is a subclass of the regular Python `dict` datastructure you
can perform all the usual actions on it. For example:

##### Get keys as a `list`

```python
list(my_piano_ballad_recordings)
```

##### Count the keys

```python
len(my_piano_ballad_recordings)
```

##### Rock `get` versus bracket indexing

```python
my_piano_ballad_recordings['Colder Weather']
my_piano_ballad_recordings.get('Colder Weather')
```

#### Gotchas

Though _almost_ the same, keep in mind that `Counter` objects **return `0`** for
keys that do not exist, rather than raise an exception or return None.

You read that correctly. Running the following assertion will result in `True`:

```python
assert my_piano_ballad_recordings['Song Not In Index'] == 0
```

Lastly, don't forget that you should only store numeric types in your `Counter`
objects. Add your string values after you're done iterating or keep them
as a separate pair.

### Inventory

So now let's build a simple set of classes for
inventory management to demonstrate how useful the `Counter` tool can be.
Along the same lines as our personal tracking of
recordings, let's assume we're tasked with tracking inventory for a record
store.

#### An `inventory` module

We will start by building out a class to represent an `Inventory`.

> As an important business requirement let's require this class to allow us to represent many different types of inventory.

Furthermore, our use case requires frequent updating of inventory numbers given
a unique product ID. A `dict` might be perfect, but maybe there's a way to
not worry about actually programming the integer arithmetic to do the
updating. _This is just inventory after all!._

**`[CHAT]: ðŸ‘‹ collections.Counter enters the chat...`**

Let's inherit from the `Counter` object and see what happens.

```python
class Inventory(collections.Counter):
    def __init__(self,):
        super().__init__()
```

Now we have a `Counter` class named `Inventory` to which we can add enhanced,
customized functionality. We can add `save`, `load`, other methods, and some metadata attributes to customize our class.

```python
class Inventory(collections.Counter):
    def __init__(
        self,
        id: Union[str, None] = None,
        data: Union[Dict[str, Any], None] = None,
    ):
        super().__init__(data)
        self.id = id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.filename = f"inventory-{self.id}.json"
        self.filepath = self.load()
```

Now we can instantiate the object with `Inventory(id="record-store", data=my_inventory_data)` or even just `Inventory()`. The `filename` and `filepath` attributes
will become clearer in short order.

**Add `save` functionality**

Now we need the ability to save our data. Let's add a `save` method:

```python
class Inventory(collections.Counter):
    ...
    def save(
        self,
    ):
        """Save the inventory object to the local database."""
        self.filepath = managedb.save_local_inventory(
            self, filename=self.filename
        )
        return self.filepath

```

**Add `load` functionality**

And because we're normal, we'd like the ability to load up that data-saving
functionality we so swiftly added.

```python
class Inventory(collections.Counter):
    ...
    def load(
        self,
    ):
        result = None
        try:
            result = managedb.load_local_inventory(self.filename)

            self.filepath = f"{os.getcwd()}/{self.filename}"
            if not result:
                return  # pragma: no cover
            for key, val in result.items():
                self[key] = val
            return self

        except FileNotFoundError:
            logging.info(f"Attempted to load {self.filename}. Not found.")

```

See the `inventory.py` file to dive into the full class. Now let's review
the `managedb` module functions you see in immediate use, above.

As you'll see in the [example below](#keeping-track-of-inventory-for-the-record-store), `Counter` is abstracted from the use of the `Inventory` object. This
is simple and allows streamlining of incremental business logic. For our use
case - building an inventory system for a record store - inheriting from
`Counter` is just the right choice.

#### Local database

Using the filesystem (or in-memory) is a quick and dirty way to build
your application logic and interfaces, as it allow the developer to avoid the
specificities required for database design and programming. We do that with the
`managedb` module here.

A major advantage of developing this way is that it forces technical focus on the
_use_ of the database prior to the developer's resources (time) being spent on
model/schema, architecture, and/or database deployment. This necessarily helps
the developer specify requirements prior to building the database infrastructure.

The `managedb` module contains just two primary functions that allow the
`Inventory` user to

- save data to disk (`save_local_inventory`), and
- load data from disk (`load_local_inventory`).

As its functionality is self-explanitory, we'll avoid a deep dive of this module
as it is out-of-scope with investigating the `Counter` class. Replace those
functions with calls to a db and you're good to go for a much more sturdy setup.

#### Tests

Testing is an incredibly important part of the software development process,
distinctly responsible for functionality quality assurance. There is not other
stage that allows the developer to _ensure_ that software written functions
as intended.

As such, we have included unit tests with full code-base coverage for these
examples. In particular, they also provide usability guides for the `inventory`
and `managedb` modules.

> ðŸŒ¶ We also included tests for the initial `counter` code!

You'll find a test for each module starting with `test_<module>.py` in the [Github repo](https://github.com/thinkjrs/demo-code/tree/main/automagically-increment-objects-in-python).

### Keeping track of inventory for the record store

So let's do a few things, such as manage inventory for a fictitious record store!
There's a test in `test_inventory.py` titled `test_Inventory_demo` which runs the code below.

#### Declare a fresh inventory

Let's declare ourselves a fresh `Inventory` object:

```python
inventory = Inventory(
    id="record-store",
)
```

You can use it like a dictionary with a few upgrades.

#### Populate the inventory with current data

Say we have the following schema for our data, with ten different records on
the shelves. We represent each with a unique `product_id`:

```python
inventory_data = {
    "<product_id>": <amount_of_product_in_inventory>,
    "<product_id>": <amount_of_product_in_inventory>
}
```

Now all we need to do is call the `update` method on your `inventory` variable.

```python
inventory.update(inventory_data)

# check sanity
for key, value in inventory_data.items():
    assert inventory[key] == value
```

Wow, that's pretty easy. The `Inventory` class inherits the `update` (and other) methods from its underlying `collections.Counter` object.

So what happens when things change, i.e. inventory needs to be updated due to a sale of a record or reorder shipment arriving?

#### Make some sales, update inventory

Making changes is easy. It's exactly like above with the `update` method. Let's record a sale of two of the same record:

```python
changes_in_inventory = {
    list(inventory_data)[0]: -2,
}
inventory.update(changes_in_inventory)
```

Check on that for our sanity, again:

```python
compare_inventory = (
    lambda inventory, test_inventory, key, val: inventory[key]
    == test_inventory[key] + val
)
assert compare_inventory(
    inventory,
    inventory_data,
    list(inventory_data)[0],
    -2,
)
```

Awesome. So what about when the manager restocks the shelves with more
records?

**Order more albums, update inventory**

```python
changes_in_inventory = {
    list(inventory_data)[0]: 1,
    list(inventory_data)[1]: 3,
}
inventory.update(changes_in_inventory)

# sanity check
assert compare_inventory(
    inventory,
    inventory_data,
    list(inventory_data)[0],
    1 - 2,
)
assert compare_inventory(
    inventory,
    inventory_data,
    list(inventory_data)[1],
    3,
)
```

#### Save the data for later

Now let's save the inventory data and reload it, keeping changes we made.

All we need to do is call the `save` method which returns the file path as a
string.

```python
filepath = inventory.save()
assert os.path.exists(filepath)
del inventory
```

#### Load the data

To load it back up simply instantiate a new `Inventory` object and chain the
`load` method to it, which returns the saved `Inventory` object.

```python
# Load it all back up
inventory = Inventory(
    id="record-store",
).load()

# sanity checks
assert isinstance(inventory, Inventory)
for key in list(inventory_data):
    assert inventory[key]

# cleanup
os.remove(filepath)
assert not os.path.exists(filepath)

assert Inventory().load() is None
```

Now you have a simple, working application to manage the record inventory on
the shelves of your imaginary record store.

Grab the code on [Github](https://github.com/thinkjrs/demo-code/tree/main/automagically-increment-objects-in-python).

### Review

In short, the standard library `collections.Counter` object can be a useful
alternative to a plain `dict`.

Record stores aside, this trivial example makes a few features clear:

- Inheriting from `Counter` is incredibly easy.
- `Counter` streamlines the simple business logic of incrementation, a common need in business application development.
- The `Counter` tool helps engender more communicative abstraction and simpler architecture.

What can you build with `Counter`? You can grab all of this including a fully-covered test suite via [Github](https://github.com/thinkjrs/demo-code/tree/main/automagically-increment-objects-in-python). And if you like what you read, sign up for our newsletter below.
